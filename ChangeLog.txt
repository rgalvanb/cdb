Version 0.4.1
http://couchdb-python.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.4.1
(???, from branches/0.4.x)

 * `schema.Document` objects can now be used in the documents list passed to
   `client.Database.update()`.
 * `Server.__contains__()` and `Database.__contains__()` now use the HTTP HEAD
   method to avoid unnecessary transmission of data. `Database.__del__()` also
   uses HEAD to determine the latest revision of the document.
 * The `Database` class now has a method `delete()` that takes a document
   dictionary as parameter. This method should be used in preference to
   `__del__` as it allow conflict detection and handling.
 * Added `cache` and `timeout` arguments to the `client.Server` initializer.
 * The `Database` class now provides methods for deleting, retrieving, and
   updating attachments.
 * The Python view server now exposes a `log()` function to map and reduce
   functions (issue 21).
 * Handling of the rereduce stage in the Python view server has been fixed.


Version 0.4
http://couchdb-python.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.4.0
(Jun 28, 2008, from branches/0.4.x)

 * Updated for compatibility with CouchDB 0.8.0
 * Added command-line scripts for importing/exporting databases.
 * The `Database.update()` function will now actually perform the `POST`
   request even when you do not iterate over the results (issue 5).
 * The `_view` prefix can now be omitted when specifying view names.


Version 0.3
http://couchdb-python.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.3.0
(Feb 6, 2008, from branches/0.3.x)

 * The `schema.Document` class now has a `view()` method that can be used to
   execute a CouchDB view and map the result rows back to objects of that
   schema.
 * The test suite now uses the new default port of CouchDB, 5984.
 * Views now return proxy objects to which you can apply slice syntax for
   "key", "startkey", and "endkey" filtering.
 * Add a `query()` classmethod to the `Document` class.


Version 0.2
http://couchdb-python.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.2.0
(Nov 21, 2007, from branches/0.2.x)

 * Added __len__ and __iter__ to the `schema.Schema` class to iterate
   over and get the number of items in a document or compound field.
 * The "version" property of client.Server now returns a plain string
   instead of a tuple of ints.
 * The client library now identifies itself with a meaningful
   User-Agent string.
 * `schema.Document.store()` now returns the document object instance,
   instead of just the document ID.
 * The string representation of `schema.Document` objects is now more
   comprehensive.
 * Only the view parameters "key", "startkey", and "endkey" are JSON
   encoded, anything else is left alone.
 * Slashes in document IDs are now URL-quoted until CouchDB supports
   them.
 * Allow the content-type to be passed for temp views via
   `client.Database.query()` so that view languages other than
   Javascript can be used.
 * Added `client.Database.update()` method to bulk insert/update
   documents in a database.
 * The view-server script wrapper has been renamed to `couchpy`.
 * `couchpy` now supports `--help` and `--version` options.
 * Updated for compatibility with CouchDB release 0.7.0.
